This new Alexa Voice Remote 3rd Generation was recently released, and I have reviewed it already as I have been using it with my FireTV Cube.\n\nCurrently it appears as though this FireTV Stick 3rd Gen is the only device that ships with this new remote, as the FireTV Stick Lite, FireTV Stick 4K, and FireTV Cube all are currently shipping with older remotes.\n\nPROS:\n\nSPEED- This is the biggest upgrade if in my opinion if you are coming from a 2nd generation device. The specs mention that this 3rd generation is \u201c50% more powerful,\u201d and you can definitely tell the difference in navigating menus and loading applications. This is probably the biggest reason to upgrade from Gen 2.\nDOLBY ATMOS \u2013 This might not be a big deal for many people, but support for the Dolby Atmos specification is nice for audiophiles with home speaker systems that can make use of it.\nREMOTE \u2013 As I mentioned in my review of this new remote, the main additions are the \u201cChannel Guide\u201d button, that brings up the menu to watch live TV if you have that set up; and the four App Buttons- for quickly launching Prime Video, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. The remote also allows control of your TV through power and volume buttons that are not available in the FireTV Stick Lite.\n\nCONS:\n\nNO 4K- This version does not support 4K video streaming, and I wouldn't imagine that it will be supported in the future either, because there is a FireTV Stick 4K product that exists if you want that feature. That FireTV Stick 4K is still shipping with the older 2nd generation Alexa Voice Remote currently though, (the one with a TV power button but no app buttons or channel guide button), so that's kind of disappointing.\n\nAll in all, this to me is worth the upgrade from and older FireTV Stick, mainly because of the speed difference but also the newer remote is nice to have. If 4K matters to you, you might want to wait and grab the FireTV Stick 4K version when they eventually start shipping it with the new Gen 3 remote. The Lite version doesn't really seem like it would be worth it in most situations, because for only $10 less you lose Atmos support and all of the TV controls (power, volume, channel guide, app buttons, etc)""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""***EDIT 05/31/2021 - READ WAY BELOW! AMAZON FIRESTICK 3RD GEN BEATS OUT NVIDIA SHIELD, CHROMECAST 3RD GEN AND ROKU****\n\nI REALLY LOVE THIS NEW DEVICE! IT IS FAST, I CAN STREAM MY OWN MOVIE APPS (CARTOON HD, TYPHOON, SYNCLAIR, FILM PLUS, NOVA, KODI, CINEMA HD) AMAZINGLY FAST!\n\nNetflix and prime is super fast also!!! I AM GOING TO ORDER 4 MORE!! AMAZON FIRESTICK BEATS OUT APPLE TV AND CHROMCAST GOOGLE TV!!!!\n\nEdit 05/03/2021: 4 days of heavy usage (horror movie marathon) and no rebooting, and the firestick has yet to lag or become slow. I switched from wireless to Ethernet and same thing: no issues at all. Absolutely a fantastic device!!!\n\nEdit 05/10/2021: posting a weekly update.\n\nThis device is even more amazing than I first noted. I have yet to experience any slowness or lag. I use it approximately 3 to 6 hours a day, sometimes over 6 hours. I use it for the Live tv option, and of course for YouTube, and audible, I am definitely not seeing any lag it is very speedy. With my 4k, at least once a week I had to unplug and plug it back in. NOT THIS 3RD GEN!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!\n\nA bit of advice on two things:\n\nFirst, the 4k firetick, while amazing as it is, is running Android 7.1, which can explain the lag between apps.\n\nThe 3rd gen runs Android 9.0, which explains the speed increase and better memory management, not to mention more secure (Firesticks are super secure, just my opinion on Android from a full time Android user). Hence, it is a better idea to get the 3rd gen.\n\nSecond, I change frequently from WiFi to Ethernet, to continue testing lagging and I have still experienced absolutely no lag. Ethernet connects at 150 Mbps, will not go higher, where as WiFi is 540 Mbps which tells me the Firesticks are made for WiFi, which makes sense however I love the Ethernet option because I have a cable available.\n\nAll I can say is, the Firestick outbeats every streaming device out there (except maybe the Nvidia shield) with reliability, speed, ease of use, connectivity. YOU ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT REGRET YOUR PURCHASE!!!!\n\nEDIT 05/19: I started experiencing lagging issues, and had to unplug and restart the Firestick, first time in 30 days! Was hoping to make it to 45 days but 30 days, with 5 to 7 hours a day of use is pretty amazing!!\n\nI made an error earlier on Ethernet speed with Amazon's Ethernet adapter. The Ethernet adapter from Amazon clocks at 150 Mbps, so I bought Cable Matters Micro USB to Ethernet Adapter and .. WOW! I connect at 349 down and almost 40 up!! I have absolutely no internet lag, on or off wifi but I always prefer Ethernet when I can use it.\n\nI managed to download and install a total of 12 applications via filelinked, and I still have 1.99 gb of space available. This firetick continues to amaze me!!!\n\nFirestick once again beats out Roku, Google Chromecast Android tv, apple tv, except the Nvidia shield. You will not regret this purchase!\n\nEdit 05/31/2021:\n\nI decided to purchase a Nvidia shield pro, so that I could compare and because I got a lot of messages stating it is the best on the market.\n\nIt was ana amazing setup, the device is powerful, and snappy. I compared it with the 3rd gen stick and the only three differences I noticed was the following:\n\nMore memory; shield has 3gb vs 3rd gen having 2gb\nSpace; shield has 12gb, can be expanded to 1tb. Firestick has 8, expandable to 512gb.\nScreen; 4k is absolutely amazing. 3rd gen has 1080.\n\nCompared with he 4k firestick, the screen is the same.\n\nSpeed is the same between shield and firesticks, and navigation is as silky smooth HOWEVER, I am noticing via Hulu, Netflix and Disney plus on shield, the voice was not matching up to the characters when watching movies and shows. No matter what I did: uninstall, reinstall all three apps, shut down and restarted numerous times. It is really annoying and does defeat the entirety of the device as a streaming device.\n\nPrice; Nvidia shield is $199, 2019 model with Android 9, April security...Chromecast Android tv is Android 10 with may security patch..at $49.99, 2020 model.... 3rd gen is $39.99 and prime day you can probably get it for $24.99..for a 2021 model. I will not rate Roku because you cannot sideload apps, and it is limited like apple streaming.\n\nWinner?\n\nAMAZON!!! AMAZON IS THE ABSOLUTE WINNER!\n\nFor price, security patches, navigation, side installing apps, ease of use... COME ON FOLKS! I DEBUNKED THE NVIDIA SHIELD MYTH!! I also am returning the shield because I cannot keep something that cannot handle streaming.\n\nNote: Nvidia shield is amazing for gaming, and absolutely beats out all streaming devices. This is just streaming applications that I have reviewed and an issue with!""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""All I needed was the remote.

It was cheap but lower quality video resolution. It was fine for the time I had it. When the same thing with improved video was being released, I jumped on it. I received it today and got it installed. The video quality is night and day as shown in the photos and much better than the 1st generation. Good work ring. Unfortunately, the installation and mounting sucks compared to the 1st generation. Why they did this, I have no clue but here are the issues.\n\n1. The mounting plate on the first generation has connections for the wiring. This made it very easy to remove the device and charge, especially in the winter months where we live and the batteries lose charge. 2nd generation has a mounting plate and the wiring on the back of the unit, which was a pain especially when the existing wire is not very long. This will be a nightmare having to remove this and recharge compared to the 1st generation. I had no issues with the 1st generation. This is a failure for Ring in my opinion. I am debating about keeping my 1st generation instead of this now.\n\n2. The mounting of the device to the frame also sucks. The 1st literally had no gaps and was secure in my opinion. It had guides that made the doorbell align to the mount. The 2nd generation does not and there are gaps all the way around and loose. I mounted it no differently than before, in fact the holes for 1st and 2nd generation are identical which is a plus, but again I see this mounting as a failure for Ring.\n\nI literally just installed this, and outside of the perfect video, I can\u2019t attest to motion and nightvision yet. I am disappointed in the execution of mounting the device. I have no idea why this changed this from the 1st generation but this was a bad move in my opinion. I still have no idea why these require a battery they never stay charged when connected to wiring, but I assume this unit will have the same issue for me as well come winter. They really need to rethink the whole battery idea and have a hardwired version and battery version or fix the way these thing function when power is applied. At this point I may deal with it and hope Ring fixes these mounting and wiring flaws. If this mounted the same way as the 1st generation, I would not be writing a review because I had no issues with the device other than the battery and that wasn\u2019t enough for me to write a review. Excellent otherwise but seriously why did you change the way these mount?\n\n***Update 6/6/2020***\n\nSo I decided to keep it primarily because I had already offered to sell my 1st generation to a neighbor, but I did end up having to make some changes. Ultimately I bought some spade terminals and soldered them to my doorbell wire with heat shrink tubing (Ring provided in older versions, but not this one for some reason). While it was easy for me, it won\u2019t be for others. Overall I am still upset over this mounting as it is extremely poor execution when the previous version was perfect. I guess this is Rings way to get the price down to $99 by cutting corners. The doorbell it self seems quality but mounting just plain sucks. I have no other words for it. You can see my updated photos of what I did. There are two photos that show the camera quality difference. The low quality image is from a generation 1 ring and the better quality HD is from the generation 2 ring. Night vision appears to be decent and motion the jury is still out because of the People only filter. I am still trying to tweak it. I am still leaving only 3 stars because of the mounting issues and there is still a gap between the mounting plate and the doorbell. Maybe Ring will fix and send everyone a new mount, but that is wishful thinking.""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2020"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-1 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""Buyer beware!

The representative was very professional, polite and knowledgeable. He was able to address most of my issues, which I will address. But I want to address the connection problem first.\n-You should know the recommended minimum requirements, which at the time of my purchase were not listed. This would have saved me a lot of time, troubleshooting, frustration and money. It is recommended your Wi-Fi internet connection have 2 MB/s download and 2 MB/s upload speeds. The way to check is using your cell phone search the internet for an internet speed test. Go outside where you\u2019d like to connect the Ring camera and run the test. If you do not meet the minimum requirements, you may experience similar connection problems. I have over 30 MB/s download but 1.90 MB/s upload speeds. This is the fastest speed from my provider in my area. I experienced long wait times for the camera to load, camera cutting out and connection error messages. I thought I had good internet speed because I can telework from home and stream video content with no issues, but apparently my internet is not fast enough for the camera. Ring support kindly offered a refund. The installation process does not seem difficult, but I personally cannot install or uninstall the camera. I had to pay someone to install the camera and will likely need to pay someone to uninstall the camera. This sucks because I needed the camera for safety purposes.\nISSUES RESOLVED:\n-The rep was knowledgeable in troubleshooting the following issues. In the Ring app setting you can select to have a live view option in the dashboard. Even better, ther is the Rapid Ring app. This app only shows your cameras with a one touch button for live view. This app is great if you miss the notification, or quickly want to see your cameras and live view. There was also less connection issues with the Rapid Ring app.\n-You can link and answer your Ring camera with your echo device. Uninstalling and reinstalling the twice fixed the connection problem I was experiencing.\n-The rep adjusted my camera\u2019s sensitivity and other tweaks to my liking.\nAmazon listing the minimum requirements would have saved me a lot of trouble. I do not know why this was not listed. As mentioned, the Ring Community Support rep was excellent, and I appreciated his effort.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo problem with picture quality or night vision. Too many bugs with the camera and app. I constantly receive the activating device notice when going into live mode. I have good Internet and the camera is about 8 feet from the router so there should be no connection problems. P If I miss a notification for answering the door and have to tap into the app there are several taps to get to live view. Why isn't there a live view button on the dashboard? Also, the Alexa skill does not work. I will get a notification on my Dot stating there's a person at the front door. When I say Alexa answer the front door it does nothing. I may send the camera back and look at other options.""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-2 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""Don\u2019t get involved with ring, I have no experience with other systems, but I think it would hard to be worse in the long run. I now own 2 door bells, a spotlight camera and a chime. Each time I buy, it\u2019s because I already own equipment and want to keep everything uniform, but regret each purchase.\n\nNot a single ring item I have owned has set up on the first try, I\u2019m pretty average on tech in 2020 but it just isn\u2019t as easy as it should be, and tech support by phone is sub par. Expect an hour of setup up time the first time as you wait on the phone, if you can get through. After you own some equipment expect an hour setup for new equipment as you update your app and each piece of equipment., seriously, I own two properties and spent most of my time with my hand on my forehead.\n\nAfter your equipment is set up and working, get ready for the real let down. Imagine you are at work, you get an alert that your doorbell has been pressed, you respond to the alert, 30 seconds later after watching a wheel spin you get to view nobody there. They left, long gone, but that\u2019s how long it takes. Furthermore, since you responded to the promp, it doesn\u2019t start recording until you can see it live. And it takes at least 30-60 sec for it to see live. So someone has pressed your doorbell, it takes 30-60 sec for the ring doorbell to establish a connection, if they haven\u2019t already left already, that\u2019s a long time waiting staring at you phone, they gave up and walked away. When you check your recorded events (at a monthly subscription price), all you get is the \u201clive video recording\u201d but since it took up to a minute to connect ( if it does, many times it won\u2019t) they have left and all you have is a recording of absolutely nothing.\nAlso, video recording is for only 14 seconds for motion alerts. So someone comes up to your driveway or front yard and scopes out you property for a bit. Then they wreck, vandalize, steal or whatever to your property. It won\u2019t be filmed ! Let me say that again, 14 seconds of recording that you pay for, per motion alert.\n\nAnd my spotlight has been connected for 2+ years, it sucks, I can rarely get a live view to work in my own home. It suddenly disconnected from my home network, looking forward to spending an hour plus getting a previously working piece of equipment to work.\n\nDon\u2019t do it\n\nUPDATE 7/22/20\n\nAfter having this for a while, some additional observations:\n-hardwiring this device solves none of the issues I mentioned above, but I guess I don\u2019t\nHave to remove it to charge it now.\n-it takes a few seconds for this to start recording in 1080. It starts recording well after someone enters the activity zone , so they are usually pretty close by the time it wakes up. For a few seconds it records at a very low resolution, somewhere around a 7 year olds sketch and recording with VHS. Expect most recordings to have low resolution when it would help identifying them, and by the time 1080 finally sets in, they have moved out of frame.\n-After 30 days you have to pay for recording service, the app will tell you that you need to subscribe, but will not provide a link in the app to allow you to Sign up, also you can\u2019t sign up within the app. You have to go to the website log in and do that.

Tambien me me llamo la atencion como discrimina tu voz entre las demas en una conversacion. Es decir, a partir de que le has dicho \""Alexa\"", solo se enfoca en lo que tu le estas solicitando, aunque haya otra conversacion de fondo en la misma habitacion, o ruido. Hemos descargado la app en el celular. Yo puedo estar fuera de casa y llamar al echo dot que esta en el playroom de mis hijos y ellos toman la llamada directamente alli. Nosotros vivimos en Paraguay, y le preguntas como esta el clima y te lo indica perfectamente. No he logrado aun conectar Imusic con Alexa, ya que me indica que esa funcion no esta disponible aun en mi pais. Asi que mis hijos estan evaluando cambiarse a Spotify. He comprado un smart doorbell compatible con Alexa, estar\u00e1 en camino. Cuando llegue pienso conectarlo para poder atender el timbre de la puerta del frente directamente desde Alexa.\nTambien hemos comprado dos echo dot con reloj, pero esos recien salen a fin de enero (supongo que era un pre-sale).

Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal. I also take medication several times a day. Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping! So I got a dot. I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer. I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness. If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes. I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that. Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders! I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR. Alexa just tells me. I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room. Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me. I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events. Finally I have a flow to my day that isnt disrupted if I chase down some internet research topic or read a little longer than planned. Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.\nI wish I had tried it much sooner. My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me! He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions. I've started to listen to audiobooks more and my imagination is soaring.

I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification. Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming. I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return.

We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all.

Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version) Games & stories cost. Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time. I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill. Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for. Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working. \""Alexa\"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother. She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music' When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again. I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics. I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of \""I'm never gonna fall in love again\"" Hello? WTHeck? Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Fr\u00e8re Jacques! Again, WTHeck? \""She\"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' \""calm my dog\"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down. I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers. This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time. I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated. Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!) Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want. Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy\"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous. If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one. Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all. I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong! I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this. You also can't tell it to \""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.\""\nThis Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions. It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day. It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm. It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was. It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds). Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given). We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it. This should be stated clearly in description and is not. We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions. It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly. If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you get nothing or something you definitely didn't want. You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by. Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with. Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th. Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music. Or relaxing instrumental violin music. In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for. I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version. and it won't just remember you want the standard version. That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.\nAND you can't ask it to do two things. Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time. It does nothing instead. You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes. You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes. More time wasting. More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember. I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for! The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want. I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why? When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.\nI read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors. I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder. Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa . Amazon actually suggests you \""Ask Alexa how she is doing today\"" Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa? And why do that? I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course. Of course? What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.\nWe don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls. We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.\nCan Alexa do this?

I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ.

Alas...\n\nThe Fire Stick 4K and the 3rd-gen Fire Stick both have a design flaw that affects users of multi-channel surround-sound receivers. When \""Surround Sound\"" is set to \""Best Available,\"" the device sends stereo content (from, e.g., live TV) to the receiver not in 2-channel PCM, but in a 5-channel \""wrapper\"" with sound on the front left and right speakers and silence on the other three. This prevents the receiver from processing the pass-through signal into 5.1-channel pseudo-surround using, e.g., Dolby ProLogic II. The only workaround is to set \""Surround Sound\"" to \""Dolby Digital,\"" which has the side effect of downgrading Dolby Digital Plus content (from, e.g., Netflix or Prime Video) to the lower-resolution legacy format.\n\nSo, the user has three choices: (1) sacrifice the receiver's surround-sound processing capability for stereo content; (2) sacrifice the higher-fidelity DD+ for multi-channel content, or (3) cycle through the menus (Home -> Settings -> Display & Sounds -> Audio -> Surround Sound -> ... ) each time and change the setting to actually get the desired sound mode. Or, the user can use one device for live TV and other stereo content, a second device for multi-channel content, and switch between devices (and remotes) each time to get the same effect.\n\nThis has been a known issue with the Fire Stick 4K for three years, discussed in the product forums, yet it never shows up in any independent reviews of these devices. My hope, obviously, was that Amazon had addressed and fixed it for the new 4K Max; I even contacted Amazon Support before pre-ordering to describe the foregoing design flaw and ask specifically if the new device would have it as well. I was assured -- twice -- that it didn't. It does. Not only has Amazon buried its head in the sand, it has purposefully built this same design flaw into two more devices: the 3rd-gen Fire Stick, and now the 4K Max.\n\nTo my knowledge, no other manufacturer's streaming devices have this problem, viz., require the user to jump through all these hoops to get DD+ surround and PL-II surround from all sources, or else do without one or the other. Every non-Amazon streaming device I have used sends stereo content to the receiver in 2-channel PCM (as does the 2nd-gen Fire Stick), and multi-channel content in DD+ where available; i.e., the pass-through audio works exactly the way it's supposed to.\n\nObviously this was the first thing I checked so I didn't bother to evaluate the device's other features and performance before it went right back in the box to be returned. If you don't use a separate sound system this device may work for you; I have no idea how it works with a soundbar but if you have a multi-channel surround receiver/speaker system, stay away from this and other Fire TV devices.\n\nI think this is it for me as far as Amazon devices go; every one I've bought has at least one annoying glitch like this, each more disappointing and exasperating than the last, and their tech-support associates either don't have a clue or flat-out lie. It's been a frustrating experience to say the least.""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2021"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-3 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""Pre-ordered (and received a day early!) as soon as I saw the spec sheets after the announcement. Finally a device that can handle all major formats for HDR (Dolby Vision, HR10, HR10+, VP9, and even AV1). One device to potentially rule all the streaming services. And pretty much the cheapest one available! I primarily use Youtube, Prime Video, and Disney+ for streaming content and Kodi to play content from my local network. I was able to set up everything well and HDR triggers were good, but the \""Match Framerate\"" feature doesn't work with Disney+. Disney+ is stuck displaying the awful 60fps (soap opera effect). Tried various settings including accessing the secret display menu, but something about how Disney+ packages their video makes the Firestick unable to match the framerate. And once that happens, it seems to break the rest of the apps for framerate. Super frustrating. I got this because I hated how my nVidia Shield didn't do VP9. It seems no streaming device exists at the moment that can hand whatever content is out there in its proper format. If Amazon or Disney (not sure who has to do it) updates their software, then it could easily be the best streaming device on the market. Until then, you will likely need multiple devices to get the max quality from all of your sources.\n\nSo close!!!!!\n\nEdit: Since the the most popular review is disparaging other reviews, let me clarify:\nNo framerate issues on Disney+ with either my computer or my NVidia Shield - only with my Firestick. Apparently the newest Apple TV 4k can produce native framerate Disney+ as well. Someone coming from older Firesticks has probably only ever had the framerate issue with Disney+ so thinks it is normal or OK.\n\nDisney+ is definitely at the crux of the issue, but the Firestick programming isn't robust enough to overcome the issue like other devices.\n\nLike I said before, this is a fantastic device, but does not have the functional capabilities that more sophisticated (or admittedly fussy) users are looking for.""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""It's funny because there are lots of people that reviewed this the day it came out and day after bagging on this item.

We just got our echo a few months ago. I\u2019ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I\u2019m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It\u2019s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I\u2019m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven\u2019t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I\u2019ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I\u2019m not sure what that is about.\nANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it\u2019s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn\u2019t just recognize it.\nSetup:\nSince my Alexa didn\u2019t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to \u201cturn off plug one\u201d and it turned off! It is so cool!\nFuture:\nI think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.\nComparing:\nWith so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can\u2019t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25. Too many are 2 for $20. While it\u2019s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can\u2019t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.\nOverall:\nIf you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do!

As a huge bonus, my upstairs plug that I previously could not control with the WeMo plug and app now works flawlessly with the Amazon plug and Alexa app. I guess it wasn't out of range after all.\n\nPros:\n1. if you're already tied into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem this just makes sense, and you keep things under control with a single app. And easily controlled with your Echo device if you wish.\n2. Really easy to add a plug via the Alexa app. Alexa will recognize it right away and you just scan the back of the plug to add it.\n3. Shorter and less bulky than the WeMo plug.\n4. Smart plugs that may have been non-responsive on my network before are working flawlessly now with the Amazon plug in use instead.\n\nCons:\n1. A bit pricey. I wish they offered multi-packs for a lower price per unit. This will probably happen later.\n2. Adding a plug to operate on an on/off schedule was NOT as easy as with WeMo. It took too many steps, was not straightforward, and should be more streamlined. Basically, you're creating what they call a \""routine.\"" You have to add a start time. Then go back and do it all over again to add an end time. So I had to create two routines to get my coffee maker to start on weekdays at 6:45am and turn off on weekdays at 7:45am. That was silly.

This was so much easier dealing with one single app (Alexa) that I will now be replacing all of my WeMo devices. I would have given it 5 stars but using the scheduling option (days and times) in Alexa required too many steps. Users should ideally be able to add start times, stop times and days when creating a schedule versus creating separate schedules for start and stop times. Perhaps a lower price would be good. Not just because I want a less expensive product but more importantly, many people have already invested a lot of money with their current smart plugs. For example, over the past years I've added (7) WeMo plugs at an average cost of $30 each and $210 for all (7).

Just a phone, an app and that\u2019s it.\n\u2022 I\u2019ve had their previous model and setting this up was even easier because all the info I had on my account (Wi-Fi password, smart-plugins, etc.) just merge in flawlessly with this Echo.\n\u2022 Alexa itself is fast. From weather to set times, to stories, and even jokes. If I want directions she responds almost instantly and overall performs excellent, like the previous model.\n\u2022 One of the perks of Amazon Echos is the vast inventory of smart devices that you can connect with. You can buy smart plugins, smart lights, and 1000s more to make your place a \u201csmart\u201d place. In this day in age, the restrictions on what a smart device can be are minimal, and overall it\u2019s a big reason why you want to buy an Echo instead of Apple\u2019s Homepod.\n\u2022 You\u2019re able to listen in on another room if you\u2019re not in the area and the Echo is. A pretty neat tool to have if you\u2019re in an \u201cuncertain\u201d relationship.\n\u2022 The Echo does an excellent job of understanding your routines. For example, my hallway, and bedroom lights are always on at the same time before bed. If I\u2019m in bed I can say \u201cAlexa, good night\u201d and Alexa will shut both of them off. This can also be used to say \u201cAlexa, good morning\u201d and Alexa can turn on any smart devices at the same time in the morning. TV, stereo, coffee maker, all you need is a smart device connector.\n\u2022 Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Deezer, Spotify. You have all the choices in the world in choosing your music channel (except of course google and apple music)\n\u2022 This Echo can connect with any of the other models of Echos, regardless of generation. This means that you just need to tap the Announce tab on Alexa and you can say/type a message of your choosing. All Echos in you have will be able to repeat what you said. I found this pretty niffy if you have kids throughout the house and you want them to come to you.\n\u2022 The light-up time and temperature are bright and never overbearing.\n\u2022 Echo can also call landlines, and any calls placed to numbers in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico for free. Note: Your Wi-Fi strength will be your indicator if the call quality will be good for you.\n\u2022 The volume on these devices doesn\u2019t bring in any distortion or cranked tones when turning this device up high.\n\u2022 Overall the volume balances heavily towards the highs and mid-tones. A decent performance for the size that it is.\n\nCons and Oks:__________\n\u2022 There is little to no volume bass in this device. The result makes an overall boomy experience. It\u2019s still decent sound but it wasn\u2019t something I was amazed by.\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t a 360 design as the fabric covering the speaker covers only around 2/3rds of the Echo. This leaves a bare wedge in the rear.\n\u2022 As much as the voice assistant is helpful, you still need to speak to Alexa with a \u201cspecific\u201d dialogue to get what you need. One of the benefits of Google in my eyes is the software in their mini. You\u2019re able to be more open in the conversational dialogue. Alexa isn\u2019t there yet.\n\u2022 For the size, I have to say that you\u2019re getting a pretty large power brick.\n\u2022 Alexa Guard is a cool feature where it can inform you in the app if Alexa hears a smoke alarm or breaking glass when you\u2019re out. I put this in the Con section because I kept getting false alarms from Alexa. I don\u2019t know if this was a glitch but I assume that a software update will fix this problem. When it does, then it\u2019s indeed a great tool to have, but don\u2019t expect it to be beneficial if you have an indoor dog/cat.\n\u2022 Amazon does have a $5/month service where the save guard will listen to footsteps and opening doors. Don\u2019t know why you have to pay for this if the software is already on the device.\n\u2022 I wish that you can buy the kids the designs for the Echo without the need to buy a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+.\n\nBottom Line:__________\n\nThis is either an alarm clock next to your bed or a nice radio when you\u2019re cooking. It\u2019s small, light, and you have the same Alexa power that Amazon\u2019s more expensive Echos have. With the price that it is, this Echo is a great way to see if you want to start making your house a \u201csmart\u201d house, or even for someone who isn\u2019t tech-savvy. I do recommend that you fork over the extra $10 and buy this Echo with the backlit clock.\n\nNow for those who have any of the previous models, this isn\u2019t worth the buy. There aren\u2019t many significant changes. The main function of this Echo is the same performance as any other model (this is coming from someone who has the previous gen). Amazon still hasn\u2019t fixed the bass issue, then again you\u2019re paying not much for this.\n\nIn the end, Amazon does a great job with the software of these devices. They\u2019re very simple to use and don\u2019t take that much power in using them. As I mentioned, one of Amazon\u2019s best perks is the vast variety of third-party dealers that the Echo can connect with. This is something that both the google mini and Apple's Homepod don\u2019t even come close to.\n\nOverall: An updated design built well for your bedroom or kitchen, but no need to upgrade from its predecessor.\n\nHope I was a help to you.\nLove,\nHonest Reviewer""}, {""review_meta"": ""Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020"", ""review_star"": ""a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating"", ""review_body"": ""Good looking \ud83d\udc4c.
